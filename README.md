# NLP Paper Summaries
This repository contains a list of NLP paper summaries intended to make NLP techniques and topics more approachable and accessible. Work in progress. There is a lot more to be added/improved in the coming days.

## How to contribute
If you have blogged about an NLP paper or technique or find an interesting read out there, I encourage you to share with our community. To add your blog posts or summaries to this list just hit on the edit button on this [README.md](https://github.com/dair-ai/nlp_paper_summaries/blob/master/README.md). You can then add your entry by modiying the readme file and submitting a PR which will be reviewed before going live. Alternatively, we can work on transferring the summaries to this repo itself so as to make them more accessible, which is what I am currently doing with some of my own paper summaries below. 

If you would like to contribute by blogging about an NLP paper/technique, you can check out our suggestion/guidance at this [issue](https://github.com/dair-ai/dair-ai.github.io/issues/23). 

And if you need any ideas on how else to contribute to this repo, take a look in the [issues](https://github.com/dair-ai/nlp_paper_summaries/issues) section. We are in need of maintainers.

For now, I have adopted a few tracks from [ACL](https://acl2020.org/calls/papers/) for the grouping but this can change based on the granularity of grouping that is needed. Open to ideas here. 

If you are facing any issues submitting your PR, just send me an email at ellfae@gmail.com or [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/omarsar0).

## TODO List
- [ ] Categorize papers; I am aiming to categorize paper summaries by using the categories in the [NLP Progress](http://nlpprogress.com/) or prominent tracks used in NLP conferences; if you have any suggestions/questions please open an issue or send me a message directly on Twitter or via email.
- [ ] Include more info about each paper summaries, excerpt, authors, source, year, etc.
- [ ] More paper summaries are coming!
- [ ] Move all paper summaries to GitHub so others can also edit, contribute, and review
